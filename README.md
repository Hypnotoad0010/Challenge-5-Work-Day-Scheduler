# Challenge-5-Work-Day-Scheduler

In this challenge I have created a Work day scheduler. Started code is given and using Moment.js to create a working app.

The app is built using Html, Css, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Moment.js

Users can use this app to add something to their busy schedule for the day and save. Past times will show gray, current show red, and future saved show green.
